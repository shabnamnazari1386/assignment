            <h2> Kabul</h2>
            <p>Kabul's food and culture are rich and diverse, reflecting the city's status as a melting pot of Afghan ethnicities. Food is a central part of Afghan culture, with meals often shared communally and featuring dishes like Kabuli Palaw (a rice dish with lamb or beef, raisins, and carrots) and various kebabs. Cultural practices emphasize hospitality, including the use of cushions and low tables for meals and the offering of tea after a meal. </p>
